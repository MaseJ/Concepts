# Design Concepts

This folder will hold concept ideas I come up with or get inspired from.
None of these will be full websites/applications but rather portions so they may lack in content.
Using this to practice making responsive animations for websites in the future. Such as landing pages, website intros, components.


## Nav Fade/Drop In
nav-dropDown

This concept is a simple way in bring in a the navigation to a simple one page website. One click of a button will make the pages fade down into the page and the button will change design to make the state of the page. 
Using HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP

## Foot Popout Concept
footer-scrollDrop

A simple way to hide a fixed footer and make it appear when wanted. Maybe not the best use of a footer because it requires you to scroll to bottom of page to see it. Either way this concept could be used on other components as well. The lines on the side of the page scrub with the scroll and give a good look in my opinion. This one does not look as well on smaller screens, It will have a little too much spacing on certain widths. I may have to mess around more to perfect the responsiveness. 

## Big Nav Hover Concept
nav-fullPageHover

Another simple idea I had. Inspired from another website to have a nav that covers the whole screen with a similiar hover effect. Originally I thought showing a small image to the side would be nice but I like the abstract look of having a zoomed in image and not really knowing what it is.
Hover effect was done purely with css and the button on top right is done with gsap. I am really liking not sticking to having everything inline and more of a abstract or random feel. Makes the page look more interesting in my opinion.
