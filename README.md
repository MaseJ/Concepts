# Design Concepts

This folder will hold concept ideas I come up with or get inspired from.
None of these will be full websites/applications but rather portions so they may lack in content.
Using this to practice making responsive animations for websites in the future. Such as landing pages, website intros, components. I will also be documenting my after thoughts of each concept and how I thought about it. This log won't be very formal but just a way to track my progress. Go to the link below to actually see the concepts in action or go to the folder to see the code itself.

## [Showcase](https://masej.github.io/Concepts/)


## Nav Toggle
nav-dropDown

This concept is a simple way in bring in a the navigation to a simple one page website. One click of a button will make the pages fade down into the page and the button will change design to make the state of the page. 
Using HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP

## Scroll Triggered Footer
footer-scrollDrop

A simple way to hide a fixed footer and make it appear when wanted. Maybe not the best use of a footer because it requires you to scroll to bottom of page to see it. Either way this concept could be used on other components as well. The lines on the side of the page scrub with the scroll and give a good look in my opinion. This one does not look as well on smaller screens, It will have a little too much spacing on certain widths. I may have to mess around more to perfect the responsiveness. 

## Nav Hover
nav-fullPageHover

Another simple idea I had. Inspired from another website to have a nav that covers the whole screen with a similiar hover effect. Originally I thought showing a small image to the side would be nice but I like the abstract look of having a zoomed in image and not really knowing what it is.
Hover effect was done purely with css and the button on top right is done with gsap. I am really liking not sticking to having everything inline and more of a abstract or random feel. Makes the page look more interesting in my opinion. 

## Grid Marquee
home-gridLayout

Starting to see more marquee ideas in web design and wanted to take a crack at it. I wanted to do a twist with it and add some hover to it. Was inspired by another web design that had the marquee hidden till hovered over. Tried to do this with gsap but thought it was simple enough to just use css. Problem is the animation kind of breaks with smaller screens but the hover will be pointless anyways so disabled it when smaller than 730px width. Also want to use a variety of words for each marquee but it messes with the timing of the animation. Maybe will go back and try to perfect it more.

## Text Reveal
text-reveal

Very quick and simple idea. Got both of these ideas from CodeGrid on Youtube. Both are actually seperate but they so small I decided to do them together. I really like the text reveal and think it would be a cool concept to do on a scroll event or on a page load. I just wanted to make it a click event to make sure I could see it. The hover effect I thought was going to be more complex but after seeing how it was done, its pretty simple. Not something I would do on every button but this or something similiar would be interesting for a call to action button. 

## Staggered Intro
page-introAnimation

Something I like and appreciate very much in modern web design is website intros. Whether its a full scale animation or something simple like this. It keeps me engaged and makes me want to go through the while website to see what other cool stuff they put in there. Becoming more comfortable with gsap and really liking it. I did not add any other effects other than the intro, I was inspired by a video of a intro very similiar to this. I have no idea if my timing or the easing is off but on some playthroughs the animations seems a little jumpy. 

## Slide Intro
page-introSlide

Had a lot of fun with the previous concept and wanted to do another intro for a web page. This one has a little box animation and then page loads in. Getting used to timing things with gsap on the timeline. Now working with these timelines is a breeze and just have to focus on making the animation look smooth. 


## Carousel & Cursor Change
carousel-cursor

This one gave me some troubles. Had a hard time making the arrow follow the cursor because I have never done anything like that. Looked up some examples and figured it out. I saw something like this on a website and wanted to try recreate it. Their carousel had content of course, but I did not want to waste time adding in content and the code to make an infinite carousel but just wanted to make the arrow change animation. Probably did will not publish this one to the main showcase because of how small it is. 

## Card Hover
carousel-hoverPop

For some reason I was thinking about how a lot of apps today have a swiping function like TikTok. I wanted to kinda recreate something like that but my own version. I have no idea what kinda of app this would be used for, maybe a online dating service? Or a shop of some kind. For this animation I made use of gsap's timeline function so I could easily play and reverse an animation when wanted. A lot easier than trying to recreate an animation in reverse. One thing I did have troubles with in this concept and the last few is the animation seems to be laggy on the first go at it. I have no idea if this is because I am doing it locally or if I am not using the correct gsap syntax at times. 

## Line & Circle Intro
intro-lineAnimation

I had a lot of fun on this one. I would make this my own portfolio but I got this idea from a different [portfolio](https://brunoarizio.com/). I really liked the design he used so I tried to recreate it with my own twist on the circle animation. This is the first time using the yoyo with the repeat on the timeline. I also learned what mix-blend-mode is in css and that is an awesome tool to use. I'll be using that one in the future again. Gsap is for sure becoming my favorite tool at the moment.

## Scroll Trigger Animation
page-scrollTrigger

This one was hard. I have played around scroll trigger in the past and never got far. Whenever I started to use pinning and scrub the spacing on everything got weird and just plain out broke. I wanted to give it a try again because it is becoming pretty popular now in many modern websites. I think this turned out ok. I ended up manually making new triggers for each animation and I am pretty sure there was an easier way to do that but I missed it. I think I am suppose to make a timeline but I did not know how to put different triggers in one timeline. A lot of things in here I could of done better but this one took awhile so I started to get tired. My next concept will most likley be similiar. I really wanna get this scroll trigger thing down and use it in upcoming projects.
