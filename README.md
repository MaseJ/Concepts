# Design Concepts

This folder will hold concept ideas I come up with or get inspired from.
None of these will be full websites/applications but rather portions so they may lack in content.
Using this to practice making responsive animations for websites in the future. Such as landing pages, website intros, components. Go to the link below to actually see the concepts in action or go to the folder to see the code itself.

## Nav Fade/Drop In
nav-dropDown

This concept is a simple way in bring in a the navigation to a simple one page website. One click of a button will make the pages fade down into the page and the button will change design to make the state of the page. 
Using HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP

## Foot Popout Concept
footer-scrollDrop

A simple way to hide a fixed footer and make it appear when wanted. Maybe not the best use of a footer because it requires you to scroll to bottom of page to see it. Either way this concept could be used on other components as well. The lines on the side of the page scrub with the scroll and give a good look in my opinion. This one does not look as well on smaller screens, It will have a little too much spacing on certain widths. I may have to mess around more to perfect the responsiveness. 

## Big Nav Hover Concept
nav-fullPageHover

Another simple idea I had. Inspired from another website to have a nav that covers the whole screen with a similiar hover effect. Originally I thought showing a small image to the side would be nice but I like the abstract look of having a zoomed in image and not really knowing what it is.
Hover effect was done purely with css and the button on top right is done with gsap. I am really liking not sticking to having everything inline and more of a abstract or random feel. Makes the page look more interesting in my opinion. 

## Big Nav Marquee
nav-fullPageHover

Starting to see more marquee ideas in web design and wanted to take a crack at it. I wanted to do a twist with it and add some hover to it. Was inspired by another web design that had the marquee hidden till hovered over. Tried to do this with gsap but thought it was simple enough to just use css. Problem is the animation kind of breaks with smaller screens but the hover will be pointless anyways so disabled it when smaller than 730px width. Also want to use a variety of words for each marquee but it messes with the timing of the animation. Maybe will go back and try to perfect it more.

## Text Reveal & Hover Animation
text-reveal

Very quick and simple idea. Got both of these ideas from CodeGrid on Youtube. Both are actually seperate but they so small I decided to do them together. I really like the text reveal and think it would be a cool concept to do on a scroll event or on a page load. I just wanted to make it a click event to make sure I could see it. The hover effect I thought was going to be more complex but after seeing how it was done, its pretty simple. Not something I would do on every button but this or something similiar would be interesting for a call to action button. 

## Page Intro Animation
page-introAnimation

Something I like and appreciate very much in modern web design is website intros. Whether its a full scale animation or something simple like this. It keeps me engaged and makes me want to go through the while website to see what other cool stuff they put in there. Becoming more comfortable with gsap and really liking it. I did not add any other effects other than the intro, I was inspired by a video of a intro very similiar to this. I have no idea if my timing or the easing is off but on some playthroughs the animations seems a little jumpy. 

## Page Intro Animation v2
page-introSlide

Had a lot of fun with the previous concept and wanted to do another intro for a web page. This one has a little box animation and then page loads in. Getting used to timing things with gsap on the timeline. Now working with these timelines is a breeze and just have to focus on making the animation look smooth.
